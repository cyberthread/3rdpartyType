# Practice 11: Web Fonts
In this practice you will implement a 3rd party font from either Google Fonts or Adobe Fonts to style a Robert Frost quote. The quote is the only content for the webpage. Consider type size, placement, whitespace and color to make an interesting (and accessible) composition. Make sure the quote has a strong presence on the screenâ€”it is ok if the page scrolls, especially on small screens.

## Parameters
- Must use relative units
- The quote and author should be styled differently including the implementation of either a different weight or style
- Implement at least one media query
- Make the site live
