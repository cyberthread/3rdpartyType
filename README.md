# The Page: A Quote
This is an exercise focused on positive and negative space and use of the page as a poster.


## Brief
For this assignment you will practice marking up a blockquote. Find a quote from a designer. That quote will be the only content for your webpage. Think about how the quote should have presence on a page, similar to a poster. Consider the type size, placement, whitespace and color to make an interesting (and accessible) composition. It is ok if the page scrolls, especially on small screens.
